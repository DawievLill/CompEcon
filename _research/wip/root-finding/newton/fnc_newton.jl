# Newtons method for scalar root finding -- univariate case from Fundamentals of Numerical Computation. 

# In Julia the docstring is found above the function, not the same as in python. 

"""
newton(f, dfdx, x1)

Use Newton's method to find a root of `f` starting from `x1`, where `dfdx` is the derivative of `f`. This returns a vector of root estimates.
